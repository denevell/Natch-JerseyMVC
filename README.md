Jersey MVC interface to android-manchester.co.uk
================================================

Work in progress. Just beginning. This replaces the old Jsp / SimpleTags version.

You currently need the rest services (See and run Natch-Runner) running on localhost:8080, unless you change the urls.

You can run it with gradle jettyStart but you need jetty-runner-9.1.0.M0.jar in the base dir.
